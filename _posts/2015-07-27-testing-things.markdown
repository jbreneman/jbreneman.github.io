That's right, I am not a writer, and I'm starting a blog anyway.

Why? It was actually a podcast that inspired this, [ShopTalk Show](http://shoptalkshow.com/). I can't recall which episode it was, but they suggested blogging just to remind your future self of how to do something. I think that is an excellent idea, and maybe my writing will improve as a side benefit.

This blog will probably be a pretty interesting mix of content. The majority of what I post will probably be HTML, CSS, & Javascript snippets and thoughts, but who knows what else I will get into in the future. I'm currently interested in React so maybe this will be a chronicle of me blundering through learning that. Other things I may blog about include general bering personal life stuff or something like that. Half the fun is jumping into something without knowing where it's going to take you, right?
